## Block ##

*NOTE*: Need to review the format.  The Postgres table is denormalized, multiple records of the Block.xml source file will map to a single record in the Postgres table.

## EquipAttach ##

NOTE: We would like to review the data to see about creating a global list of generic attachment types and linking the specific attachments for equipment
to those.  If a pattern is found, there will be a mapping developed between these records and the global list of attachments (which will be in a new HETS table).

NOTE: The combination "Equip_ID" + "Attach_Seq_Num" must be used as the "OldKey" in the ImportMap table.

| Created_By          | EquipmentAttachment | CreateUserid         |       |

## EquipType ##

*NOTE*: The HETS EQUIP_TYPE table contains a global, generic list of EQUIP_TYPES.  The HETS DISTRICT_EQUIPMENT_TYPE table will be the true target of the XML source. 

*Note*: The XML table is set at the Service Area level and in the new application, we would like it mapped at the District level, so a mapping is needed to apply that change. An interim, hand-constructed oldkey/newkey mapping may be needed to handle that.

## EquipUsage ##

*Note*: In the new HETS design, we have the "RentalAgreement" record through which we can get the links to Equip_Id and Project_Id. 
If we use that, RentalAgreement records will be created from groups of EquipUsage records with common key of Equip_Id+Project_Id (+ possibly Year(Worked_Dt)).

Alternatively, we simply add "Equip_Id" and "Project_Id" fields to the

## Rotation_Doc ##

*Note*: Need to investigate this XML file to determine the format and how to map it. It appears to map to the RentalRequestRotationList, but it does not have the transactional data that is expected.

## Service_Area ##

*Note*: This table will not be mapped. Instead - we need to verify that the table matches up with the one from School Bus. It will be loaded with the JSON files via the API as part 2 of the start up process.

## User_HETS ##

*NOTE*: Only load users that have IDIR IDs. There may be BCBid users - they will not be converted, and BCeID users - they could be, but again, will not.  We may get a list of the non-converted users for the Business to work with. In necessary, we'll load those users via the API process.

*NOTE*: Based on the Authority, UserRole and GroupMembership records will be created for the user.  Investigation needed to determine the authorities in BCBid, what they mean and to what Roles/Groups they should be mapped.

# Flow #

- Load process starts the first time with the database empty
- The Server starting up creates the Database schema
- Secrets are loaded into the new database
- An Admin user runs an API script to load fixed data into database tables from generated JSON files
- An authorized user initiates the first import process - via an API call passing in the location of the unzipped files and a list of all the Districts in the system - converting all XML data
- Load order is as defined in the table at the top of this Readme.
- Time passes and the system is used by one District
- ...
- Time for another District to go live on the system
- START OF LOOP
- The BCBid Data is exported, prepared, delivered and upzipped on the HETS server
- An authorized user initiates the next import process - via an API call passing in the location of the unzipped files and a list of all the Districts in the system EXCEPT for the District(s) already live
- Time passes until it's time to go live with another district
- LOOP until all Districts are live on HETS
